The city's street parking system, which charges a fixed rate, is struggling to keep up with the increased demand. => modify the pricing scheme to better promote social welfare.

one spot is left unoccupied (so that it is available in case someone really needs it).

Markov decision process (MDP) to model the demand for parking with a reward function that reflects its preferences.
